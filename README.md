# 2026Hydroinformatics

Code repository for the **CEE 6110 – Hydroinformatics** course (2026).

This repository is used to practice version control concepts introduced in class, including repository creation, file management, branching, merging, push and pull requests.

## Repository Purpose

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate:

- Creating and managing a GitHub repository  
- Editing files directly through the GitHub web interface  
- Organizing code using directories  
- Committing code to the `main` branch
-  Comment before commit changes
- Creating feature branches and merging them via pull requests

## Workflow Summary

- The repository named 2026Hydroinformatics was created using the GitHub web and GitHub desktop interface.
- This `README.md` file was modified to include custom descriptive content.
- One source file (date/time functions) was added directly to the `main` branch.
- A new feature branch (`new-feature`) was created to add a temperature conversion code file.
- A pull request was opened and merged to integrate the feature branch into `main`.
- After successful merged, the added new feature branch was deleted through GitHub desktop app.
- Comment message before commiting any changes for example either updating readme.md file or changing something else in the repository.

## Source Code Description

### `datetime_functions.ino`

Contains basic date and time utility functions demonstrated in lecture.

### `temperature_converter.ino`

Added via a feature branch. The code implements temperature conversion logic (e.g., Celsius to Fahrenheit) as part of branch-based development practice.
